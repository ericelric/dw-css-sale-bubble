# CSS Sale Bubble

This is a demo of a responsive sale bubble.

* Usage: 
	* Add the classes "bubble-sale" and "tip-left" / "tip-right" to your div.
	* The bubble needs a wrapper class to adjust the font-size and positioning.

Example:
```css
<div id="position-bubble">
	<div class="bubble-sale tip-left">Made with love!</div>
</div>
```
